    "Objective:\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the implementation of a Naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Embedding Model: `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vector Database: `Epsilla's vector database`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Large Language Model (LLM): `meta.llama3-8b-instruct-v1:0`\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we use is BONTONSTORESINC_04_20_2018-EX-99.3-AGENCY AGREEMENT and ENERGOUSCORP_03_16_2017-EX-10.24-STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT from the Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (https://github.com/TheAtticusProject/cuad)\n",
    "\n",
    "We also demostrate evaluating RAG correctness with 3 metrics:\n",

Payments of Royalties and Service Fees will be due on a calendar quarterly basis, within [***] days after the end of the\\ncalendar quarter in which the applicable Licensed Products were Sold or services were rendered. From the date a payment is due, unless otherwise\\nagreed, any late payment will accrue a late payment fee of [***] per month, or the highest interest rate permitted by law, whichever is less.\\n \\n9.4 Reports. Each payment made hereunder will be accompanied by a report detailing (a) the total number of units, on a product-by-\\nproduct basis, of the Licensed Products Sold during the previous calendar quarter, (b) DIALOG’s and its Affiliates’ Net Sales attributable to such\\nLicensed Product units during such calendar quarter, and (c) reasonable details regarding the calculation of the quarterly Royalty payment and\\nService Fee.

With respect to its exercise of the rights and licenses granted in, and payment obligations under, this Agreement, DIALOG and\\nits Affiliates will keep accurate books and other records, including but not limited to supporting documentation for the Royalties and Service Fees\\npaid hereunder (the “ Records”). These Records will be maintained for a period of at least three (3) years from the date of the related payment\\n(“Record Retention Period”), notwithstanding any termination of expiration of this Agreement.\\n \\n9.6 Audit Rights. During the Record Retention Period, ENERGOUS may appoint a mutually agreed independent, internationally recognized\\nthird-party certified auditor who will have the right to inspect and copy the Records upon reasonable prior notice, and DIALOG will (and will cause\\nits Affiliates to) allow necessary access including, as applicable, to its premises where such Records are located. ENERGOUS may exercise such\\nright to this independent-third party audit no more than one time per calendar year and each such audit will be conducted during normal business\\nhours. Such audit may also not interfere with DIALOG’s or its Affliates’ quarterly closing of its books. In the event that such audit reveals an\\nunderpayment of Royalties or Service Fees owed by DIALOG, DIALOG will promptly pay ENERGOUS the amount of the underpayment. If such\\nunderpayment is in excess of [***] of the Royalties or Service Fee due for the period audited, DIALOG will also reimburse ENERGOUS for its\\nreasonable, out-of-pocket cost of such audit. In the event that such audit reveals an overpayment of Royalties or Service Fees owed by DIALOG,\\nENERGOUS will promptly pay DIALOG the amount of the overpayment.\\n \\n* Confidential Treatment Requested\\n  Page 12  \\n \\n \\n9.7 Taxes. Each party will be responsible to collect, bear and pay any and all taxes levied or based upon the party’s sale of the Products,\\nProduct Die or Licensed Products, including, all sales, use, value added, withholding or similar taxes.

The receiving party agrees (a) not to copy or use the disclosing party’s Confidential Information except and only for\\nthe purposes contemplated by this Agreement, (b) to maintain it as confidential, and exercise reasonable precautions to prevent unauthorized\\naccess, use and disclosure, (c) not to disclose it to any third party other than the receiving party’s employees and contractors who have a need to\\nknow for the permitted purpose and who are bound by obligations that are at least as protective as the restrictions in this Agreement and (d) not to\\nexport or re-export in violation of U.S. or other export control laws or regulations any such Confidential Information or product thereof. Each party\\nwill bear the responsibility for any breach of this Section 10 by its and its Affiliates’ employees and contractors. Upon any termination of this\\nAgreement or, in the event of any Wind Down Period or Continuing Obligation period, upon the expiration of such period, and within fifteen (15)\\ndays after request by the disclosing party, each receiving party will return the Confidential Information of the other or destroy such Confidential\\nInformation and all copies of it and all information, records and materials developed therefrom, except that the recipient may retain one copy for\\narchival purposes to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, and nothing contained herein will require the erasure, deletion,\\nalteration or destruction of any Confidential Information required to be retained for legal or regulatory purposes or stored on back-up tapes or other\\nback-up media or archiving systems made in the ordinary course of business, subject in each case to the confidentiality obligations set forth herein.\\nEach party may only disclose the general nature, but not the specific terms, of this Agreement without the prior consent of the other party;\\nprovided, however, either party may provide a copy of this Agreement or otherwise disclose its terms on a confidential basis in connection with\\nany legal or regulatory requirement, financing transaction or due diligence inquiry. For clarity, in the event that use, disclosure or retention of any\\nConfidential Information is required in order for DIALOG to exercise the license granted in Section 2, this Section 10 will not be deemed to prevent\\nsuch use, disclosure or retention.\\n \\n  Page 13  \\n \\n \\n10.3 Required Disclosure.

As such, any warranty claims due to defects in\\nbuild, materials or workmanship will be directed to the Manufacturing Subcontractors as part of that contract between DIALOG or, if applicable, its\\nAffiliate and such parties.\\n \\n(c) With the exception of the warranties in Section 11.2(a)(ii) (third party IP infringement) and Section 11.2(a)(iii) (misappropriation\\nof third party trade secrets) related to any Product Die, the warranties in this Section 11.2 do not apply to MCMs or repackaged Product Die\\ndeveloped by or for DIALOG or its Affiliates.\\n \\n(d) In the event any warranty claim is due to or arises from an Epidemic Defect, ENERGOUS will be responsible for all costs and\\nexpenses directly incurred by DIALOG or its Affiliates or their respective customers as a result of reasonable inspection, servicing, repairs,\\nreplacements, recall notices, recalls and responses with respect thereto, provided that ENERGOUS’ aggregate liability to DIALOG and its Affiliates\\nand their respective customers under this paragraph (d) will not exceed [***] per occurrence of an Epidemic Defect. Each party will immediately\\nnotify the other upon becoming aware of the circumstance that could reasonably be construed to be an indication of an Epidemic Defect, and, in\\nany event, will notify the other party immediately upon becoming aware of the existence of an Epidemic Defect. ENERGOUS and DIALOG will\\nexpeditiously work together in good faith to determine a technical resolution of the Epidemic Failure. ENERGOUS agrees to make all commercially\\nreasonable efforts to promptly diagnose the Epidemic Failure’s root cause, provide DIALOG a report detailing the results of ENERGOUS’\\ninvestigation and plan an effective workaround and a permanent solution. ENERGOUS will consult with DIALOG on any proposed workarounds\\nand other solutions.\\n \\n* Confidential Treatment Requested\\n  Page 15  \\n \\n \\n11.3 Infringement of Intellectual Property Rights . If any of the Products, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials is, or in\\nENERGOUS’ or DIALOG’s opinion is likely to become, the subject of an Intellectual Property Rights infringement claim, and as a result DIALOG or\\nany of its Affiliates or their respective customers are enjoined, or in ENERGOUS’ or DIALOG’s opinion are likely to be enjoined, from using the\\nProducts, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials, ENERGOUS will use its best efforts to:\\n \\n(a) procure for DIALOG and its Affiliates and their respective customers the right to continue to use the Products, Product Die,\\nDocumentation or Deposit Materials, as applicable; or, but only in the event that, despite ENERGOUS’ best efforts to do so, ENERGOUS is unable\\nto so procure such right,\\n \\n(b) replace or modify the Products, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials, as applicable, to make them non-infringing,\\nprovided that the replaced or modified Products, Product Die, Documentation and Deposit Materials remain substantially similar in performance to\\nthe infringing Products, Product Die, Documentation and Deposit Materials.\\n \\nIf none of the foregoing alternatives is available within a commercially reasonable time period, DIALOG may terminate this Agreement with\\nimmediate effect, provided that it will give ENERGOUS prompt prior written notice thereof. Nothing in this Section 11.3 is intended to limit\\nDIALOG’s rights to indemnification under Section 12 in connection with any such infringement claim.\\n \\n11.4  Disclaimer.
