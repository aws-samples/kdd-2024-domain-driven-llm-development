## Hands-on Labs Introduction

All the methods explored in the tutorial are introduced in this hands-on lab to demonstrate how RAG and LLM fine tuning works, and how they perform to handle domain specific LLM tasks. 

#### Target audience
This hands-on is aimed to developers and data scientists that want to improve their knowledge about the techniques and concepts explored in the tiutorial.

#### Pre-requisites 
The audience will get more benefits from this tutorial if having the following pre-requisites:
+ Foundational Understanding of Generative AI (pre-training, fine-tuning and, RAG)
+ Programming Skills, Python proficiency
+ Basic Understanding of Machine Learning
+ Foundational Knowledge of Natural Language Processing (NLP) or Large Language Models (LLM)

#### Hands-on labs 
The hands-on activities are implementing through three labs:
+ The first two labs implement the __RAG and FT techniques__ covered in the tutorial.
+ The third lab compares both approaches exploring two dimensions, __performance and costs__, in order to support decision making related to which solution adopt baed on cost comarison analysis.
